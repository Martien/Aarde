A {pearl} is like a {pattern}, yet differs in subtle ways:

- ***wish* rather than problem** is the character of the {pearl}, simply because of this:
  - **Focus on your problems and your goals disappear.**
  - **Focus on your goals and your problems disappear.**
- **[BLUF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLUF_(communication)) gets you started quickly** by pulling the *therefore* and *constitution* to front, while pushing the – often long-winded – *rationale* to the end, unlike the {pattern} that follows the *problem* with the *rationale*.

{pearl}s have a simple and fixed structure:
> *name* → *context* → *wish* → *therefore* → *constitution* → *rationale*.

### **Praxissophia**
**{pearl}s capture _working wisdom_** – knowledge, skills and experiences – to enjoy your work and life more than before. For example, the {talking stick} helps you have your say during meetings.

So, if you have a problem, first turn it into a wish and look for the right {pearl}s. Rethink problems to {pearl}s.
