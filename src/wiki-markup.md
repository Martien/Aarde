# Wiki & Pearl Language

This site supports Wikimedia-style links and {pearl}s in Markdown.

So,
```md run=false
   Click [[wiki links|here]] to learn about [[/Wiki]] links.
```

results in:

> Click [[wiki links|here]] to learn about [[/Wiki]] links.


Also, text in curly brackets, like:
```md run=false
  {pearl}, {pearl language}, and {city country fingers}
```
result in:
> {pearl}, {pearl language}, and {city country fingers}

and their corresponding link, allowing you to grow a {pearl language}.

**Some day**: Some references are *dead links* or *yearning pages*, or, as Wikipedia calls them: <span style="color:red;">red links</span>. Having this supported on this web site remains a wishâ€¦
