# Nomad
### 2007-04-03

Nicole Recourt sent me email on Ramsay's [film on giving and receiving from our planet Earth](http://www.nomadslife.tv/):

> I've been organising a cross media project, film-documentry-internet series-book whose purpose is to follow four people travelling to remote parts of the planet in search of Nomadic tribes.

Nicol says Ramsey is talking with one of our universities to use a bus fueled by hydrogen (or fuel cells perhaps?).

The film is beautiful indeed!

Hey Nicole, who is this Ramsey anyway?
