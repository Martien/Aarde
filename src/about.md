# About
Since the beginning of the web – somewhere in the nineties, when I was working at [Sun Microsystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems) – I have been writing posts. I used a myriad of domains to publish them – `martien.steenbergen.nl`, `aardrock.com`, `aardrock.nl`, `martien.aardrock.com`, `martien.aardrock.nl`, `therockfamily.nl`, `pearllanguage.org`, `pareltaal.nl`, `aardnoot.nl`, and a handful of subdomains, often a wiki. I exlusively used [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) and [Mediawiki](https://www.mediawiki.org).

Since 2010, converting all these web sites to a static site has been lingering in the back of my head…

Since 2018, I have been using [Observable](https://observablehq.com/@martien), an ideal combination of Markdown, JavaScript, SVG, CSS, and D3.

Observable reminds me of [NeWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeWS) (Network extensible Window System), a windowing system developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1980s. NeWS is device independent, and used [PostScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript) as programming environment and rendering engine. Very versatile and powerful, especially for its days. NeWS was way ahead of its time. I have been longing for a similar platform ever since. Enter Observable…

Early in 2024, Observable announced [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework/), an open-source **static site** generator for data apps, dashboards, reports, and more. **Wow!** I can use JavaScript, SVG, CSS, D3, Markdown, and more to have all of my posts published fast and cheap.

Late 2024 – at the age of 66 – I decided to collect all of them on a single place and clean them up.

We’re talking about hundreds of posts. A long list of post titles is not the way forward. So I need a way to organize them into specific clusters or categories. Hence, I need a collective term for these specific areas of interest. So, this site uses [[zones]].
