# markdown-it-container

This site uses the `markdown-it-container` to facilitate writing and maintenance of {pearl}s and {pearl language}.

For instance,
~~~md
::: name
country city fingers
:::
~~~
results in:

::: name
country city fingers
:::

You can use any of the keywords mentioned above to fence off a specific section of a {pearl}. This will format each section accoring to the traditional way of Christopher Alexander’s *A Pattern Language*.

The remainder of this page shows an example of the rest of {country city fingers}.

::: context
the distribution of towns required to make a balanced region—{distribution of towns}—can be further helped by controlling the balance of urban land and open countryside within the towns and cities themselves.
:::

::: wish p
Continuous sprawling urbanization destroys life, and makes cities unbearable. But the sheer size of cities is also valuable and potent.
:::

::: therefore
Keep interlocking fingers of farmland and urban land, even at the center of the metropolis. The urban fingers should never be more than 1 mile wide, while the farmland fingers should never be less than 1 mile wide.
:::

::: constitution
Whenever land is hilly, keep the country fingers in the valleys and the city fingers on the upper slopes of hillsides—agricultural—{valleys}. Break the city fingers into hundreds of distinct self-governing subcultures—{mosaic of subcultures}, and run the major roads and railways down the middle of these city fingers—{web of public transportation}, {ring roads}
:::

::: rationale p
People feel comfortable when they have access to the countryside, experience of open fields, and agriculture; access to wild plants and birds and animals. For this access, cities must have boundaries with the countryside near every point. At the same time, a city becomes good for life only when it contains a great density of interactions among people and work, and different ways of life. For the sake of this interaction, the city must be continuous—not broken up. In this pattern we shall try to bring these two facts to balance.

Some more rationale

> Unique as we may think we are, we are nevertheless as likely to be genetically programmed to a natural habitat of clean air and a varied green landscape as any other mammal. To be relaxed and feel healthy usually means simply allowing our bodies to react in the way for which one hundred millions of years of evolution has equipped us. Physically and genetically, we appear best adapted to a tropical savanna, but as a cultural animal we utilize learned adaptations to cities and towns. For thousands of years we have tried in our houses to imitate not only the climate, but the setting of our evolutionary past: warm, humid air, green plants, and even animal companions. Today, if we can afford it, we may even build a greenhouse or swimming pool next to our living room, buy a place in the country, or at least take our children vacationing on the seashore. The specific physiological reactions to natural beauty and diversity, to the shapes and colors of nature (especially to green), to the motions and sounds of other animals, such as birds, we as yet do not comprehend. But it is evident that nature in our daily life should be thought of as a part of the biological need. It cannot be neglected in the discussions of resource policy for man. (H. H. Iltis, P. Andres, and O. L. Loucks, in <publication>Population Resources Environment: Issues in Human Ecology,</publication> P. R. Ehrlich and A. H. Ehrlich, San Francisco: Freeman and Co., 1970, p. 204.)
