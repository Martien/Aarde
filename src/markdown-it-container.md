# markdown-it-container

This site uses the `markdown-it-container` to facilitate writing and maintenance of {pearl}s and {pearl language}.

For instance,
~~~md
::: name
country city fingers
:::
~~~

results in:

---
::: name
country city fingers
:::

index: true
---

You can use any of the keywords mentioned above to fence off a specific section of a {pearl}. This will format each section accoring to the traditional way of Christopher Alexanderâ€™s *[[A Pattern Language]]*.
