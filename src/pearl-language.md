Unlike the {pattern}s in a {pattern language} that describe a problem and its solution, {pearl}s describe a wish and offer practical ways to fulfil that wish, all in a specific context or situation.

- **Focus on your problems and your goals disappear.**

- **Focus on your goals and your problems disappear.**

**Praxissophia** – **{pearl}s capture _working wisdom_** – knowledge, skills and experiences – to enjoy your work and life more than before. For example, the {talking stick} helps you have your say during meetings.

So, if you have a problem, first turn it into a wish and look for the right {pearl}s. Rethink problems to {pearl}s.

You can use `{parel}`, `{parel}` and `!parel!` to get {parel}. `{parel}` is the default because it is easiest to type.

You can also use `{parel|alternate text}` to get {parel|alternate text}, while still linking to {parel}.
