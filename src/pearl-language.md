- **Focus on your goals and your problems disappear.**

**Praxissophia** – **{pearl}s capture _working wisdom_** – knowledge, skills and experiences – to enjoy your work and life more than before. For example, the {talking stick} helps you have your say during meetings.

So, if you have a problem, first turn it into a wish and look for the right {pearl}s. Rethink problems to {pearl}s.
