# Love—The Purest Form of Energy
### 2007-03-26

**To Love is a verb, so hard work it is.** And Love (with a capital L, in order not to be confused with its romantic meaning), passion, is the ultimate source of energy, strength and creativeness in the universe.

My energy, my love, is focused on creating and nourishing a family, an organization, and software in a balanced way that, one way or another, can help make the world a better place—a **Whole Earth**.

This Love aims to make the total very much larger than the sum of its parts, make it whole, coherent, and give it a quality without a name. And if I can't love it, how can I expect anyone else to?

I strongly believe in an open, trustworthy, respectful, patient, and loving environment where I can work hard to serve and lead the people around me, and to bring out the best in them and make them thrive, so they can unfold their potential.

### Collective Intelligence


Knowledge and imagination bring more and more economic value than raw material. The prosperity of a nation, geographical region, business, or individual depends on their ability to navigate the knowledge space (or cosmopedia) around which the new collective intelligence is organized goes beyond the image and text characteristic of print-based encyclopedias as we know it.

New computer technologies such as the semantic web will serve to filter and help us navigate knowledge, a multidimensional space, and enable us to think collectively rather than simply haul masses of information around with us.

Collective intelligence is a universally distributed intelligence. No one knows everything, and everyone knows something. We are passing from a Cartesian model of thought based upon the singular idea of cogito (I think) to a collective or plural cogitamus (we think).

The computer and software are the instruments that makes this utopian ideal possible. For if we are able to better communicate and understand, we will create a better world. Wisdom.

The more we are able to form intelligent communities, as open-minded, cognitive subjects capable of initiative, imagination, and rapid response, the more we will be able to ensure our success in a highly competitive environment.

Knowledge has become the new infrastructure. Our living knowledge, skills and abilities are in the process of being recognized as the primary source of all other wealth. Internetworked information would then provide the technical infrastructure for the collective brain or hypercortex. I will do everything in my power to catalyze this still emerging phenomenon.

### Love is all you need


I want to love what I do, and do what I love. Aiming to propel the semantic, social and business web to further success, as it has all the ingredients to do just that. I'm giving it my heart, my mind and my soul.

**Thrilled in harmony.**
