# Crisp deltas

This DNA is a remix of [Crisp NDA](http://dna.crisp.se/) and therefore a [[klonen|clone]].

This page is in English so we can share the key differences between the two DNAs with anyone, especially with people from Crisp.

- We use verbs for the majority of page titles, because verbs denote action, activity.
- We have sociocracy as foundation, with a good dose of holacracy as well.
