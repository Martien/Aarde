::: context
…you are working with others – coworkers, frineds, family. You are inclined to over-deliver, want to give more than receive – be a generous giver, inclined to say yes to request, want to be liked.
:::
::: wish
You want to protect and cultivate your self-worth: deserving attention, energy, and respect. You want to sustain and grow your well-being while comfortably sustaining all your current commitments and deliver on those promises.
:::
::: therefore
Use **magic sentences** that stop others – narcissists in particular – in their tracks when they demand your time, attention and energy. Whether you're dealing with a boss or a coworker or someone you just met or even someone you care about for a long time.
:::
### Magic sentences
1. **No.** – denies others access to your attention and energy.
2. **I’m not available for that.** – shuts down requests the cross your boundaries.
3. **I’m not willing to do that.** – communicate that you and you alone manage your time and energy.
4. **I don't have time for that.** –  draws a clear line letting others know that your time is reserved for what you value, not what the others crave.
5. **I cannot afford it.** – emphasize that your energy is limited and that you won't waste it on things that don't align with your priorities.
6. **I don't have the capacity to take that on.** – communicates that you are protecting your emotional and mental space so you can comfortably sustain doing your best for the current commitments.
7. **That doesn't work for me.** – stresses your identity and independence.
::: rationale
You receive self-worth by investing in those same **qualities** in yourself:
* **attention**;
* **energy**; and
* **respect**.

Therefore, set, clearly communicate, protect and assert your **boundaries** to:
* end manipulation – make you unmanipulatable;
* protect and build self-worth;
* protect something that:
  * you have earned, invested in;
  * is rightfully yours;
* actively keep narcissists – those energy suckers – away

**Boundaries**:
* focus on you;
* are rules for how you act and where you stand for;
* are merely the process of communicating who you;
* define what works for you what you want or what you feel;
* define you as a different and independent self;
* send a clear signal that others cannot affect, dictate or control you, and will not get what they crave from you

**Narcissists**:
* cling to an imaginary facade they've created
* always try to cover up the fact that they are artificial fragile and empty
* leave you exhausted and depleted
* are deeply envious and threatened by your ability to be separate and whole
* are entirely motivated to:
  * steal your sense of being,
  * leech off of you;
  * drain you in an attempt to fill the void within them.
