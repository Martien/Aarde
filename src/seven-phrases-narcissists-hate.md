::: context
you are working with others – coworkers, friends, family. You:
- are inclined to over-deliver,
- want to give more than you receive – be a generous giver,
- are inclined to say yes to many requests,
- want to be liked.
:::
::: wish
You want to protect and cultivate your self-worth: deserving attention, energy, and respect. You want to sustain and grow your well-being while comfortably sustaining all your current commitments and deliver on those promises.
:::
::: therefore
Learn to {just say no} and use **magic sentences** that stop others – narcissists in particular – in their tracks when they demand your time, attention and energy. Whether you're dealing with a boss or a coworker or someone you just met or even someone you care about for a long time.
:::
### Magic sentences
1. **No.** – denies others access to your attention and energy.
2. **I’m not available for that.** – shuts down requests the cross your boundaries.
3. **I’m not willing to do that.** – communicate that you and you alone manage your time and energy.
4. **I don't have time for that.** –  draws a clear line letting others know that your time is reserved for what you value, not what the others crave.
5. **I cannot afford it.** – emphasize that your energy is limited and that you won't waste it on things that don't align with your priorities.
6. **I don't have the capacity to take that on.** – communicates that you are protecting your emotional and mental space so you can comfortably sustain doing your best for your current commitments.
7. **That doesn't work for me.** – stresses your identity and independence.
::: rationale
You receive self-worth by investing in those same **qualities** in yourself:
* **attention**;
* **energy**; and
* **respect**.

Therefore, set, communicate, protect and assert your **boundaries** in order to:
* end manipulation – make you unmanipulatable;
* protect and build self-worth;
* protect something that:
  * you have earned, invested in;
  * is rightfully yours;
* actively keep narcissists – those energy suckers – away.

**Boundaries**:
* focus on you;
* are rules for how you act and what you stand for;
* are merely the process of communicating who you are;
* define what works for you; what you want or what you feel;
* define you as a distinct and independent self;
* send a clear signal that others cannot affect, dictate or control you, and will not automatically get what they crave from you.

**Narcissists**:
* cling to an imaginary facade they've created to hide their void;
* always try to cover up the fact that they are artificial fragile and empty;
* leave others and you exhausted and depleted;
* are deeply envious and threatened by your ability to be separate and whole;
* are entirely motivated to:
  * steal your sense of being;
  * leech off of you;
  * drain you in an attempt to fill the void within them.
