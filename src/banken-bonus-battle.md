# Banken Bonus Battle
### 2010-03-14

Dan Roam doet het rookgordijn dat de superrijken hebben opgetrokken—[[Miljardairs 50 procent rijker in 2009]]—glashelder uit de doeken.

---

A couple weeks ago Dan Roam met with potential clients at an investment bank in New York. President Obama had just announced that he was going to levy a $120 billion fee on Wall Street Banks to recoup money lost in the initial $700 billion TARP bailout.

The bankers were understandably upset. After all, they'd already paid back their share of TARP, but now they were being told they'd have to pay back money that had been paid to OTHER organizations. Huh? Dan admits that angry as he was about the crazy Wall Street bonuses he was hearing about, that still didn't make a lot of sense.

We taxpayers bailed out the banks, but the banks paid back everything they'd been loaned, plus interest. So why the lingering anger from DC?

Then Dan drew the pictures and (as always) when we stop talking and start looking, things have a tendency to become real clear real fast. See the full story in this clip Dan recorded for BNET / CBS Interactive…

## Open letter to Dan Roam

Dear Dan,

I like your Bonus Battle so much that I've reblogged it here.

At the same time I challenge you to open this smoke curtain played out by the plutocracy using banks and government as expendible pawns.

What do you see when you look at [World Billionaires Grew 50% Richer In 2009](http://rense.com/general90/world.htm)? What image emerges then? What video makes that?

Please Dan, you're an expert in making complex things and their impact understandable and accessible. Do mankind and planet Earth a pleasure and create another video on what really goes on behind the (smoke) curtains.

Dan, beware of tunnel vision.
