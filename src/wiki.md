This site supports Wikimedia-style links in Markdown.

```md run=false
   Click [[wiki links|here]] to learn about [[/Wiki]] links.
```

results in:

> Click [[wiki links|here]] to learn about [[/Wiki]] links.


Also, text in curly brackets, like:
```md run=false
  {pearls}, {pearl language}, {closure}, and {pure function}
```
Convert to specific pearls and their corresponding link, allowing you to grow a {pearl language} â€“ akin a {pattern language}, like so:
> {pearls}, {pearl language}, {closure}, and {pure function}.
- {independent regions}
