# Helping others makes us happy
### 2007-10-04

How coincidental. Yesterday [Thomas Herald](http://www.dreammanifesto.com/about-us) from [Dream Manifesto](http://www.dreammanifesto.com/) writes about [Longest running study shows helping others makes us happy](http://www.dreammanifesto.com/longest-running-study-shows-helping-others-makes-us-happy.html).

And today I receive [Mike Dooley](http://tut.com/mike_dooley.htm)'s [Note From The Universe](http://www.tut.com/nftu.htm), stating the same:

> First, as a child, it seems like the entire world is there for you and you rush to drink from its every cup, sometimes wondering to yourself how anything could ever be more fun.

> Then, as you grow older, if you're observant, you realize **much of what you enjoy was made possible by the contributions, work, and labor of those who came before you**, and you're taken aback, disappointed even , because with maturity you can now see cracks in the façades, imperfections in the details, and 10,000 ways it could have all been done better.

> At which point, folks typically choose one of two paths: Spend a lifetime lamenting how far from perfect things are. Or, to one degree or another, **roll up their sleeves and pitch in**.

> And should they choose the latter with gusto, dear Martien, they will come to know, to the core of their **sacred being**, that the differences they might make in the world cannot be made by another. And then they will discover the answer to their often-wondered childhood question… That the most fun one can have in time and space comes from making such a difference, and that the joy derived from serving is 10,000 times that of being served.

> At your service –
> > The Universe

> Oh, no, Martien. This doesn't mean life becomes all work and no play. It just means **work becomes play**, no matter what you do, and **play becomes ecstasy**.
